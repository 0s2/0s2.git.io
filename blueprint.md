## Cyclone Simulator Rewrite Blueprint
**Monsoonjr99's plan for the rewrite regarding features and implementation**

* This file serves as a guide for rewriting Cyclone Simulator with planned features in mind
* Code architecture should be flexible and ready to accomodate future additions including these planned features and other suggestions
* Not everything listed here needs to be added by release v1.0, and this file can guide future updates after the rewrite is released
* I should update this file whenever I plan a new addition
* Plans here are flexible and may change
* Plans here shouldn't be too detailed about implementation, since the actual implementation may easily be different
* When an addition is completed (including partially), a note should be added saying:
    * what is done
    * what is left to do
    * and any differences in implementation from the plan
    * multiple notes may be needed for any changes over following versions (more technical than changelog.txt; not as in-depth as in-code comments)

***WIP***
