About: A p5.js tropical cyclone simulation game

v20190207a:
    + Added EPac, WPac, and Aus name lists alongside the existing Atl list
        > Use the name list selector in the basin creation menu to access
        > Atl and EPac lists behave per year; WPac and Aus lists are sequential regardless of year (just as you'd expect)
    * Hurricane-strength tropical cyclones now come in 3 flavors: Cyclone, Hurricane, and Typhoon
        > Currently tied to the selected name list; to be made its own option later
v20190206b:
    + Added "Hyper Mode"
        > A new option in the basin creation menu allows for a very hyperactive basin
    * Damage over $1 trillion now displays as T instead of 1000s of B
    * Storms are now named "Unnamed" after the Greek alphabet is exhausted instead of "Name #"
v20190206a:
    + Added some future-proofing for when saved environmental field analysis data is loaded in a version with an incompatible environmental field algorithm
        > The old data will be deleted and map layers will display "Unavailable" in analysis prior to the tick the basin was loaded
    * Optimized how season-crossing storms are stored for saving/loading purposes
v20190204a:
    + Added part of the season loading algorithm (still WIP)

    + Added a couple functions for data compression purposes for saving/loading
v20181222a:
    + Added a basic test for basin saving/loading
        > Saves just the seed of the latest basin generated
        > The "'Load' From Seed (test)" button uses the saved seed to generate a new basin (does nothing if no seed is saved)
v20181218a:
    + Added a basin setting for the starting year of a simulation
        > The default of "Current year" is the current Jan-Dec year for NHem and Jul-Jun year for SHem

    + Added damage and deaths, including counters in storm and season stats
        > The damage/deaths algorithm is rudimentary and may need change
v20181216a:
    + Added "Total ACE" counter to season stats
v20181215a:
    + Added "Jump to" button to side panel, which (while paused) "jumps" analysis to a specific point

        > In storm stats, jumps to when the targeted system first formed as a disturbance
v20181207a:
    + Added counter for category 5s in season stats
v20181203c:
    + Added arrow buttons to side panel for navigating through season stats

    + Added text wrapping for storm info panel
    * constant-ified UI colors (plus some color tweaks)
    * Storm info panel no longer directly tied to selected storm
        > Now has its own "target" storm that changes in tandem upon clicking a storm icon
    * Fixed glitch with mouse-hover over overlapping UI elements
v20181201a:
    + Added an "extended storm info" UI box accessible by clicking the info text in the upper right while a storm is selected

    + Added wind shear environmental field
    + Added new "coast outline" rendering for land for moisture field
    * Large change to storm algorithm to make seasons less hyperactive and somewhat more realistic
        > Looks to need to be ironed out quite a bit over the next few verisons
v20181111a:
    * Big improvement to upper-level steering to make it less drunk and more realistic
v20181110a:
    + Added a currently-very-drunken upper-level steering field
    * Storm steering algorithm changed to follow both upper and lower-level steering based on strength and if extratropical
        > True "wind shear" not quite added yet as storms don't yet weaken
v20181109b:
    + Readded environmental wobble
    * Optimized environmental fields for future saving & loading of basins
v20181109a:
    * Changed snow-rendering algorithm for faster and more efficient rendering
v20181105a:
    + Added code for a graphical shader that gives land some shadows and visible depth
        > Disabled until user settings are added since it increases render times
    * Adjustments to SST anomalies to use a more logarithmic system, and have greater anomalies closer to the poles
    * Definition SST values for equatorward and poleward edges at peak-season and peak-off-season moved to constants.js
v20181102a:
    * Reworked land to work more efficiently with cleaner code
    * SST map layers now render more nicely with the land and are now less laggy when the sim is running
    * Clicking the map layer text/button in the bottom now rotates through the map layers
    * The data displayed in the map layer button now shows that at the position of the selected storm if one is selected
        > includes indicator for if the data is "@ mouse pointer / finger" or "@ selected storm"
        > if the selected storm is not active at the time viewed in analysis, data for the mouse pointer / finger is displayed

v20181030a:
    * Steering is now much less drunk
    * Fujiwhara improvements
v20181028a:
    + Added a "Start" button when the sim loads, which will initialize the sim upon being clicked
        > This is to help make things load faster, but is also for future user-customizable basin UI
    + Added graphical rendering for environmental fields
        > Both plain-value and vector-based fields supported, rendering with colored tiles and arrows respectively
        > Press "E" to rotate through the environmental fields, and back to "none"
        > Currently, steering is the only environmental field, so "E" is more of a toggle for now
    * Optimized the environmental field code for future environmental factors, including adding vector support for current steering
        > Steering may have gotten yet more drunk for now
v20181026b:
    * Fixed SHem steering behaving even more drunk than the NHem already is
        > Both hemispheres still drunk; just SHem isn't as drunk
v20181026a:
    + Crikey mate! Added the southern hemisphere
        > No whole-world added yet, so a basin is just one hemisphere or the other; 50/50 chance at generation
    + Added a 'basin' object and moved some variables there for future saving/loading and user management of basin settings
    * Now displays "Land rendering..." while the land is rendering instead of holding the page in a loading cycle
v20181024b:
    + Added snow that changes with the time of year for aesthetics
        > Snow depends on both elevation and latitude to give a realistic look
    * Cleaned up code for colors so they're actually defined in constants.js, and made land colors less hardcoded
v20181024a:
    * Changed land colors to make land look better
    * Changed how selected storm outlines are drawn to make them look better
    * Split the code into multiple files to begin some cleanup and refactoring

    * Slightly lowered spawn rate
    * Land generation is now seeded with the time, which is stored in a "seed" variable
v20181015a:
    + Added a makeshift "track forecast" to selected storms; yellow dots show where the storm might go (is often wrong!)
v20181014a:
    * Fujiwhara tweaked to make stronger storms and extratropical systems more "dominant" in the interaction
    * Simulation speed now works in powers of 2, with a 6th speed option added
        > Full-Speed, Half-Speed, 1/4 Speed, 1/8 Speed, 1/16 Speed, and 1/32 Speed
    * When a storm is selected, only the selected storm's track shows
v20181013a:
    + Readded subtropical storms, using different mechanics
    + Added fujiwhara interaction (Might need tweaking)

v20181004a:
    * Made steering completely drunk for the moment (will be fixed)
    * Changed canvas dimensions to 960x540 as to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio
    - Temporarily removed subtropical storms
        > System behavior hasn't yet changed, but they're just classified as extratropical, thus expect E5s
v20180810a:
    + Added clickable UI elements/buttons, opening the door for more possibilities in this sim along with better mobile compatibility
    + Added a pause button, which works alongside the existing "space"
        > The indicator text also functions as an extension of the pause button when a storm isn't selected
    + Added a date navigator UI, which can be accessed by clicking the time in the upper left
        > Using the arrow buttons, you can jump through analysis by the year, month, day, or advisory increment (6 hours)
        > The arrow keys still work alongside this new UI
    + Added rudimentary seasonal activity; storms should now be more common and stronger in September than in January
    * Some tweaks to steering
v20180731a:
    + Added environmental steering; may need some work
    * Some adjustments to storm strength algorithm
    * Spawning frequency and ranges adjusted
v20180729a:
    + Storms now keep track of their peak intensity (by pressure), including all associated data at the point of peak intensity
    + Added ACE
    * Inactive selected storms now display their full name as of peak intensity, plus ACE
    * You can now hold down the arrow keys in analysis to quickly move backwards and forwards
v20180728b:
    + Added 5 different simulation speed levels: Full-Speed, Half-Speed, 1/3 Speed, 1/4 Speed, and 1/5 Speed
        > Press "[" to slow the simulation down and "]" to speed the simulation up
    + Added indicator in the upper-right (when a storm is not selected) for simulation speed and if the sim is paused
v20180728a:
    + Added subtropical and extratropical storms
        > Spawn extratropical systems with "x"; subtropical storms cannot yet be spawned
    + Added pressure; wind speed is now based on pressure
    + Added a temporary environmental gradient for determining extratropical vs. subtropical vs. tropical
    + Added clicking storms to select them; selected storms appear with a white outline and display info in the upper-right
    + Added all 6 name lists plus Greek alphabet, which should rotate appropriately through a 6-year cycle
    * Big refactor to make more-efficient classes for future saving and loading basins
    * "Lows" are now specifically "tropical waves" as opposed to extratropical lows
    * Storms now spawn in one of two locations based on if they're extratropical or a tropical wave
    * Strengthening/weakening algorithm changed significantly for handling new extratropical and subtropical systems
v20180721a:
    + Added analysis, allowing you to see history of the sim by pausing and pressing the left and right arrow keys to move forward and backward through time
        > Unpause (or press "A" for single-tick advance) to return the time to the present without spamming the right arrow key
    + Added some code for "seasons" (quite unfinished)
    + Added lows, which are anything below 20 mph, which was where storms died before
        > Storms now die when they drop below 0 mph
        > Hold "L" and click to spawn a low
    * Tracks now disappear as soon as a storm dies, but it can still be seen in analysis
    * Storm icons are now rendered with a method of the StormSystem class to make analysis work more easily
v20180719a:
    * Fixed mouse events blocking default browser actions when cursor is outside the canvas, which made it impossible to access the changelog using the link (sorry)
    * Fixed first segment of tracks not rendering immediately
v20180718b:
    * Storms are for now named with a continuously looping 2022 Atlantic hurricane name list (Will be changed)
    * Tracks are no longer rendered every frame, but only when needed, making the sim run faster
    - Removed tracks dissappearing when the framerate drops below 25 fps, as it's no longer needed thanks to the improvement above
v20180718a:
    + Added names:
        > Depressions recieve a number with the suffix "H" for "Hypothetical"
        > Named storms are all named "Unnamed", as this is incomplete
    + Added code for environment factors such as "shear" and "SSTAnomaly", but are not in use yet
    * Changed each simulation tick from 30 minutes to an hour:
        > Storms now move twice as fast as seen by the viewer, although they move at the same speed in simulation time
        > Strengthening/weakening code is still the same per-tick, so behavior has changed somewhat
    * The time in the upper left uses a slightly different format now
    * Fixed keyboard events blocking default browser actions like "F5" for reload or "F12" for javascript console, except in cases involving keys used for the simulation ("space" doesn't scroll the page down)
v20180713a:
    + Added pausing using "space"
    + Added a date counter; currently serves no purpose
    + Added spawning using the keyboard and mouse:
        > Hold "D" and click to spawn a tropical depression
        > Hold "S" and click to spawn a tropical storm
        > Hold "1" and click to spawn a category 1 hurricane
        > So on for keys "2" through "5"
    + Added stepping one frame (30 sim-minutes) at a time while paused using "A"
    + Added a method to display storms' windspeeds underneath them, enabled using "W"
    * Changed land rendering to better show height
    * Fixed(?) issues involving higher-definition display devices
    * Tracks of dead storms now disappear whenever the framerate drops below 25 fps, not just after their timeout
    * Changed canvas dimensions to 1100x500
    * Tweaked land generation
    % Added moment.js for date and time calculations and display
v20180712a:
    + Added land, which weakens storms
    * Made tracks thicker
    * Actually added the CSS and version number to make this consistent with my other experiments
    * Changed rendering so storm symbols always render above tracks
    * Slight tweak to storm strength calculation besides land interaction
v20180709a:
    + Initially created a simple hurricane simulator without much regard to realism, nor any land
    % Using p5.js for the first time for any of my experiments
